 Hi, I'm Angelica. ðŸ‘‹

My interests lie in utilising data to develop sustainable systems. 
I'm currently enrolled at AiCore where I'm training to become a data scientist as I've always wanted to solve certain problems but didn't have the skills to until now. 
Recently, I've discovered an interest in computer vision, which I'm excited to explore further.  
If you share my passion please don't hesitate to reach out. Together, we can make a difference and create a more sustainable future for all :)
